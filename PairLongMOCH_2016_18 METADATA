YEAR: Year of the breeding season during which the data were collected.

BOX: Number identifying a specific nest box within the study site (some numbers are repeated across elevation sites, but not within sites)

ELEVATION: Elevation site where 
   H = high elevation
   L = low elevation

M.ID: Male's 10-digit hexadecimal PIT-tag ID

M.EXP: Male's reproductive experience as of that YEAR's breeding season (see Methods for how this is determined and what these levels mean)

F.ID: Female's 10-digit hexadecimal PIT-tag ID

F.EXP: Female's reproductive experience as of that YEAR's breeding season (see Methods for how this is determined and what these levels mean)

PAIR.EXP: The combined experience of the pair of breeders or pair composition
   Experienced = Both male & female are experienced breeders
   Inexperienced = Both male & female are inexperienced breeders
   Mixed = One mate is experienced while the other is inexperienced

NEW.PAIR: Is this a newly-formed breeding pair this YEAR?
   N = No
   Y = Yes

EXPD.CLASSES: This is only defined for pairs of experienced breeders (pairs[which(pairs$PAIR.EXP == "Experienced")]) and says whether this is a pair that has bred together before or a new pair that has formed from divorce
   From.Divorce = Newly formed pair of experienced breeders that formed from divorce (see Methods for details)
   Not.From.Divorce = Newly formed pair of experienced breeders that formed from mate loss (see Methods for details)
   Old.Pair = Pair of experienced breeders that bred together the previous year (see Methods for details)

FIRST.EGG: Date on which the first egg was laid, clutch initiation date. MM/DD/YYYY format not used in analyses, but included for clarity


J.FIRST.EGG: Day of year in which the first egg was laid, clutch initiation date. This was used in analyses, see Methods for details.

CLUTCH: Clutch size, number of eggs present in nest upon incubation initiation

BROOD: Brood size 15 days post hatch

MEAN.MASS: Mean nestling mass. Mass of each nestling measured 15 days post hatch
